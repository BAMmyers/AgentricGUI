# AgentricGUI
In development
be gental its my first time all alone.
  
  The overview, main purpose or goal of this project is to create a A user-friendly GUI node workflow-based program harnessing the power of AI and technologies to streamline the creation of AI agents and their processes on a single platform. It is intended that these agents or AI programs be implementable and deployable assets upon completion of creation in the GUI. We look to create a community-driven project that can be hosted on GitHub or open source for access to APIs and other AI-driven technologies to be used in the creation of parameters and skill sets for the AI agents, focusing on user-friendly capabilities. Create an easy-to-understand node-based workflow creation tool focusing on AI agent creation that the novice AI hobbyist would be interested to use alongside and in addition to the degreed or seasoned coder and AI specialist. As the bedrock of this program, AI technologies is the driving computing of this program, meaning we want to link it to any and all open source AI background programs to keep it so that there's no human error in the coding and production of the AI agents from the platform itself, remembering that access tokens, API keys, permissions, account permissions, and connections, and all of those things are necessary in today's field of AI development to even have permissions or access to these technologies. Therefore, there needs to be a comprehensive menu for data entry of access tokens, API keys, account information, and other things like that. Use Google Gemini or Google API for those nodes of collection due to its vast structure and different aspects of those nodes, much like n8n, the program used for workflow development for AI creation. n8n is an amazing project, but not very user-friendly in the sense that everything to a finite detail has to be personally input by the user rather than baseline connections and account access is granted and then the AI takes over. Essentially, I'm wanting the user to be able to log on and approve or deny edits, changes, and creations by the AI, let the AI do its thing, and the background of coding, analytics, access permissions, and anything else, because AI thinks a million times faster than humans. So why wouldn't you want that person to be in charge of the construct and development of these technologies, but always keeping a human connection in the loop where the AI has to verify the approval of the edits, changes, and creations within the framework.
Use code with caution.
Okay, so in a sense, what I'm wanting to do is make a GUI that allows for the user to have access to a plethora of tooling and other constructs for editing and creation of AI agents and building them into a network of enterprise and or like a drop-down for workflow creation where you can build the agent and then move the agent from a drop-down list of your entries and you can pull it over to the graph or the canvas where you can then link the different agents or the different nodes together. It needs to have a sign-on by email address for basic data retrieval and history recording, linked to your Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, or whatever the case may be. Then upon sign-in, you have three tabs: Create or New, Console or Command, and Settings. The dropdowns are depicted in the settings tab for adjusting email accounts linked to it and basic parameters like dark mode or light mode for the console itself. Using a basic GUI structure for the background of everything. Let's see here. And then update for firmware. There has to be an option for the updating of the code to make sure everything keeps running smoothly and have it tied to my repo host at github.com. I can host repos out of that, so that's an asset. Then for the creation tab, obviously, you have it. First selection is, you know, create an agent or create a tool. Yeah, so those basic options, and then when you enter into those menus, those will bring you into more detailed, robust options, such as link LLMs, link APIs, and have that be an option in there. For your console, that's the main command center, if you will, where you communicate with your agent task force or workforce to actively operate, deploy, test, and edit code. Do all that, and so that's the initial sign-on and entry into the program, you know, your main menus.
imaggen User hears about the program and is wanting to create and utilize an AI agent that will take notations and write emails in regards to those notations. So they would log on, find out that it's easy to create an account using your own email, and that's it. Everything else happens in the background. They would go through the dropdown menus of the initial creation of their AI agent, and these menus would be for naming the agent, general purpose task prompt, and sliders for yes/no access to the Internet for data and personal filings on your computer, and any other subsequent access decisions on a toggle panel. Upon the creation of the initial agent, they will then have the ability to go into the console tab. Upon entering the console tab, see the options for console command and delegation, which will allow them to select from a menu of their already created assets and, using AI, instruct those assets on their tasks and obligations. Once the AI agent is deployed and off doing its job, at any point in time, the user can sign on, checking their console for active agents and be given a return of active sub-processing right out of active task real-time processing on the console, printed on the console. If an agent is off task or no longer needed, there is a kill switch for each agent within the console, accessible through a simple command or button press that will allow the termination of that process and the discontinuing of any and all actions that the agent was held responsible for. Noting in the citations of the initial account setup that any and all actions taken by agents created on the platform under the user, the users therein are responsible for, and the website or the program is not held liable for any of those actions after that point. Simply a GUI for the creation and innovation of AI technologies for implementation in the use of AI agents.
